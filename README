#######Java Test##############

Your challenge is to read in the attached AddressBook file, then programatically answer the following questions:

1. How many males are in the address book?
2. Who is the oldest person in the address book?
3. How many days older is Bill than Paul?

Feel free to commit as often as you'd like. We will be looking at how you apporoach the task and how you structure your code to answer the questions.

Good Luck!
