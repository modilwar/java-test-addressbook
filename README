#######Java Test##############

Your challenge is to read in the attached AddressBook file, then programatically answer the following questions:

1. How many males are in the address book?
2. Who is the oldest person in the address book?
3. How many days older is Bill than Paul?

To get bonus points you can create a RESTful API for the address book which would allow clients to interact with the address book and answer at least one question from the above list. 
If you choose to go for the bonus points feel free not to do anything about question #3. Please do, however, submit a pull request before you start working on the REST api. We are big fans of "fail fast" principle and we are keen to give you feedback as soon as possible. 

Some insights on what we'll be looking for (and what we will be not):

- it is a maven project so feel free to use maven and maven dependency management
- Feel free to commit as often as you'd like. The more commits the better!
- It's better to complete 1 task than to start 3
- feel free to use any java libraries you feel appropriate 
- Please commit at least once within the first hour. 
- Please feel free to spend as much time on the task as you like and make the solution and the code as perfect as you like
- We will be looking at how you apporoach the task (e.g. how you break it into sub-tasks) and how you structure your code to answer the questions.

Good Luck!


#######INSTRUCTIONS TO DEPLOY AND USE REST SERVICE##############

To deploy the REST service type 'mvn jetty:run' in command promt from root of the project

REST API

1 . POST to http://localhost:8080/api/contact to add contacts to address book
    Requires JSON request body in following format:
    {
        "name" : "name",
        "gender" : "Male or Female",
        "dob" : "dd/MM/yy"
    }

2.  GET on http://localhost:8080/api/contact to get list of contacts from Address Book
    With optional parameters:
    order_by=age
    order_how=[desc | asc]
    limit=[1..infinity]


2.  GET on http://localhost:8080/api/contact/count to get count of contacts in Address Book
    With optional parameter:
    gender=[male | female]



To add all the contacts found in the AddressBook file:

Send POST requests to http://localhost:8080/api/contact with the following request bodies
{"name" : "Bill McKnight", "gender" : "Male", "dob" : "16/03/77"}
{"name" : "Paul Robinson", "gender" : "Male", "dob" : "15/01/85"}
{"name" : "Gemma Lane", "gender" : "Female", "dob" : "20/11/91"}
{"name" : "Sarah Stone", "gender" : "Female", "dob" : "20/09/80"}
{"name" : "Wes Jackson", "gender" : "Male", "dob" : "14/08/74"}


To answer question 1:

Send a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/contact/count?gender=male
The response should be the following JSON:
{
    "count" : 3
}

3. To answer question 2

Send a GET request to using http://localhost:8080/api/contact?order_by=age&order_how=desc&limit=1
The response should be the following JSON:
{
    "contacts" : [
        {
            "name":"Wes Jackson",
            "gender":"Male",

        }
    ],
    "count":1
}
